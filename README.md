# generative-text-model-
A text generation model built using GPT-2 or LSTM to generate coherent paragraphs based on user-defined prompts. Includes a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how the model responds to various topics using natural language generation techniques.
> Inside

* `README.md`: This file.
* `text_generation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating text generation.
* `input.txt` (optional): Example user prompts.
* `output_text/` (optional): Folder for generated outputs.

> Quick Use

1.  Install necessary libraries (if `requirements.txt` exists: `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
